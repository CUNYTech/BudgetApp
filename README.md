# BudgetApp

React-Native start up instuctions:
`git clone https://github.com/CUNYTech/BudgetApp.git`

`cd BudgetApp`

`cd react_native_frontend`

`npm install`

IOS:
`react-native run-ios`

ANDROID:
`react-native run-android`


I added notes attempting to explain what's going on.
The current flow of the react-native app is the following:

IOS:
index.ios.js > app > main.js > components/page1.js

ANDROID:
index.android.js > app > main.js > components/page1.js
