BudgetApp(placeholder) aims to bring you financial freedom through habit forming social interactions.
Putting your budget on paper or in a basic spreadsheet is essential if you want a healthy financial future. Creating a
detailed budget can help you reach your financial goals, whether you're saving for a car, buying a home or paying off
student loans. By *sticking* to a budget, you can save **THOUSANDS** of dollars each year and avoid overspending.

Sticking to that budget is often the hard part. BudgetApp streamlines the process of staying on top of your budget by
allowing you to bring it with you whenever you go. The drive to maintain your budget and use it everyday is reinforced
with your own customizable social network. Add friends and family to your network and allow them to see your budgeting
score, and also allow you to see theirs. If someone you follow hasnt updated in a period of days, you can Pokeâ„¢ them
to let them know you see they are slacking, and vice versa.
