/**
 * Filename: launch.json
 * Purpose: This is just the file needed for the React Native environment to work correctly inside of Visual Studio Code 
 * It allows you to have the language loaded and debug the various OS's. It should have stayed local but I guess
 * since it is in the root of the folder it got uploaded to git as well.
